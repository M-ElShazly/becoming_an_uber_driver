![uber-everywhere](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103464869/198420955-1a830889-7ecd-48d2-8d88-0bf6b65340e6.png)

This repo contains a full analysis of the trips, routes, and pricing data of Uber. Uber is a transportation company with an app that allows passengers to hail a ride and drivers to charge fares and get paid. More specifically, Uber is a ridesharing company that hires independent contractors as drivers.


The insights from this project were presented inside MicroStrategy Workstation. For quick access, a summary of insights & screen shoots is available in this [**Slide Deck**](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1bEHOxBG0vFUtOBV097XxyQPbmetrcAemB6gyrk0LbUU/edit?usp=sharing) 

## 1. Objectives
One of main objectives of this project was to answer questions like: 
1. How does uber uses near real-time data to determine fare prices? **(Uber's Dynamic Pricing)**
2. Does factors like weather affect _surge factor_ used by uber to determing trip fares? 
3. What best practices & routes can drivers adhere to for optimal earnings?

Furthermore, explore the potential of analysing real-time data from drivers in a specific area to provide **Drivers** with live recommendations to allow better use of their time, and increase _per hour_ earnings. 

## 2. Data Sources
